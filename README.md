In this project, we examined the differences between real and modeled DDM observations for two trained models. We performed statistical analysis, in particular, error computations such as Mean absolute error (MAE), Root mean square error (RMSE) and Normalized RMSE to investigate how close or far the modeled DDM observations for the two models are from their corresponding real DDM observations. This was done by binning the models' datasets on wind speed statistics to further examine if extreme wind speeds affect the accuracy of modeled observations. Furthermore, the performance of these models was compared using Peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).
Ideally, we hope that our project helps the sponsor answer their question of how well their machine learning operator performs for minimum and maximum wind speeds. It is our hope that we form a conclusion that is well-suppoprted by our error analysis, and that Spire can utilize that to test their assumption and consider making some changes to their neural network architecture to improve the machine learning model's performance. In addition to that, we hope that our project can give the sponsors an explanation on whether the addition of the feature mentioned above is necessary.
